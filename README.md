# Excida RealtyScript
## Features
Excida RealtyScript is a PHP based reality website content management system. It is the framework behing thousands of real estates website found on the web.

## History
Excida RealtyScript was originally a paid script product. I no longer had time to support the business, so I've decided to convert it to a MIT licensed open source project. It is 100% open source. There are no "premium" or "paid" add-ons, etc.

## Green Developer Friendly
If you are not an experienced developer, this script is very easy to setup and extend. It doesn't use and extra libraries. Its very easy to find the place that code needs to be modified in order to make the changes you need.

It is very well documented as well. 

## I Need Help removing Ioncube:
Because the script was originally a commercial product, it used IonCube to ensure proper licensing. I need help removing IonCube completely so that it easy for other developers to download and use. If you are able to do this, please create a pull request and I'll happily accept.
