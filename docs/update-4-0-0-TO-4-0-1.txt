*	Listing description in admin/user edit listing area was mistakenly showing the seller's description
*	Price can be entered in any format (e.g. $199,999 or 199,000, etc.) and system will strip out commas/currency
*	Turning the availability calendar to OFF didn't disable it from showing on the view listing page
*	The price slider on the home page wasn't working properly in iOS (iPad/iPhone)

*	Admin editlisting area wasn't able to update a listing package
*	Seller results page wasn't displaying the profile image
*	Suppressing default timezone errors by adding an ampersand to date_default_timezone_get()
*	Logging in was failing if the username contained an uppercase letter
*	send_mailing() function mistakenly referenced $email rather than $bcc for individual emails, so some were not being delivered

*	PHPMailer will now catch and display exceptions to make debugging email issues easier
*	Fewer fields are now required for user registration (no longer required: bathrooms, half baths, bedrooms, status). This makes it quicker to list, especially properties that aren't residential (e.g., land only or commercial that do not have bedrooms, etc.)
*	The "default" image for a listing is the one you uploaded most recently
* 	Added text on the log in page and links to register to make it easier/more obvious for new users what to do
