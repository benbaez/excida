UPDATE PMR 3.4.0 to 3.4.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Please see /docs/upgrade.txt for upgrade instructions.

CHANGELOG:
+	WYSIWYG editor has been fixed to resolve an issue where the screen would grey out during certain actions and nothing could be clicked on (e.g., when inserting images / adding links).
+	The Google Maps API has been upgraded to v3, which no longer requires a Google Maps API key to use the system and overall performs better. The Google Maps API class originally being used, Phoogle, has been retired for a new class created specifically to work with Google Maps API v3. This should resolve several issues for many international addresses.
+	The 'default' or 'blue' template has been updated to include a drop-down menu on the right-hand side to allow visitors to the site to select the language as well as the template of their choice.

UPDATE PMR 3.4.1 REVISIONS
+	Bug with PHP short codes
+	Only using session_register() now if the function is detected (to be PHP 5 compatible)
+	.DS_STORE sometimes visible in the template drop down menu
+	CMS editor WYSIWYG editor works with pop ups now (e.g., for inserting images, links, etc.) Previously, it went blank and greyed out the screen.
+	Bug fixed in submit.php where duplicated emails being used would produce an error, but not display what it was
